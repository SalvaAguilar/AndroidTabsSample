Android Tabs Sample

This project was made with the intention to show in an easy sample how to manage tabs in android applications using ViewPager and PagerTitleStrip, instead of inserting the tabs inside the action bar.
With this solution your tabs are safe to any change of orientation in your device, keeping always under the actionbar.
As it used the compatibility library, it is safe to work in old android versions.
